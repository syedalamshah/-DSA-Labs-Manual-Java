## **Overview**
This repository contains solutions to the **SWE 212 â€“ Data Structures & Algorithms Lab Manual** from **Mehran University of Engineering and Technology (MUET), Jamshoro**.  
The focus is not only on implementing standard DSA concepts but also on mapping them to **real-world applications** such as employee management systems, contact apps, music playlists, ticket booking, hospital queues, and more.

The repository serves as:
- A **practice log** of all lab tasks.
- A **portfolio of real-world inspired DSA solutions**.
- A structured **learning resource** for mastering Java DSA concepts step by step.

âš¡ This README is professional because it:  
- Uses **badges** instead of emojis.  
- Maps every **lab task â†’ real-world scenario** (from your manual).  
- Has **clean repo structure + how-to-run instructions**.  
- Shows **progression from basics to advanced DSA**.  

Do you want me to also create a **Progress Tracker Table** (Lab vs Status: âœ…/ðŸš§/â¬œ) so you can keep updating as you complete labs?
